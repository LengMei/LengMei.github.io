    <section id="description">
        <p> I received the B.Eng. degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2005 and Ph.D. degree from The University of Hong Kong in 2011. </p>

        <p> I worked as a research fellow at the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering Nanyang Technological University from 2011 to 2014. I joined TL@NTU as a research scientist in August 2014. </p>

        <p> I am currently working on navigation algorithms and their implementation on software-defined radio testbeds. My general research interests include cooperative and distributed computing algorithms, and machine learning with their applications to wireless sensor networks and wireless communication systems.</p>
